# LabVIEW Composition

Implements functions to compose and decompose objects, clusters, maps and sets in LabVIEW, effectively breaking [encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)) by making private data accessible. Use with caution!

*Note*: Maps and Sets are available in LabVIEW 2019 and later.
